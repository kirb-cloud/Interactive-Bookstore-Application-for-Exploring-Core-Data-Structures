# Bookstore - Comprehensive Data Structures Project  
*Calculator, Bookstore, and Tester System*

## Project Overview
This project is a **menu-driven Python application** designed to demonstrate the implementation and usage of fundamental data structures through three practical applications:

1. **Calculator**  
   - Parses arithmetic expressions with variables.  
   - Checks for balanced parentheses.  
   - Builds parse trees for evaluation.  
   - Supports assignment of variables and evaluation of expressions.  

2. **Bookstore System**  
   - Loads a catalog of books from a file.  
   - Supports search, browsing, and shopping cart management.  
   - Uses binary search trees and hash tables for efficient lookup.  

3. **Tester**  
   - Provides a framework for running predefined test cases.  
   - Ensures correctness and validates the implemented data structures.   

## Key Features
- **Custom Implementations** of core data structures (not relying on Python’s built-ins for core functionality).  
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module focuses on one task (Calculator, Bookstore, Testing).  
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Includes parsing, balancing checks, searching, sorting, and tree traversal.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Menu-driven system for ease of navigation.  

## Data Structures Implemented

### Linear Structures
- **ArrayList** – Resizable array with insert, delete, and index operations.  
- **ArrayQueue** – Queue using circular arrays.  
- **ArrayStack** – Stack using arrays.  
- **SLLStack** – Stack implemented with a singly linked list.  
- **DLL (Doubly Linked List)** – Node-based list with forward/backward traversal and efficient insert/delete at both ends.  
- **DLLDeque** – Double-ended queue using a doubly linked list, supporting add/remove from both ends in O(1).  

### Non-Linear Structures
- **BinaryHeap** – Priority queue supporting insert and extract-min/max.  
- **BinaryTree** – Base class with preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals.  
- **BinarySearchTree (BST)** – Insert, search, and delete operations in O(log n) on average.  
- **ChainedHashTable** – Hash table with chaining to handle collisions.
